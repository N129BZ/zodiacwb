# Zenith Zodiac Weight and Balance
Application for calculating a visible w&amp;b chart for Zenith 601xl and 650 aircraft

This is a work in progress - Imperial/Metric functionality via menu: Edit -> Measurement Units -> Imperial (lbs) or Metric (kg)
- Note that the official Zenith 602/650 Weight and Balance arms are given in millimeters, since the aircraft design was metric to begin with!
- If you have an AMD Zodiac and the POH lists the empty weight arms in **inches**:
  -  Multiply arm inches x 25.4 and round to remove any decimal values
  -  Enter the arm values into the empty weight section of application 
  -  Save using the save button
  -  **You'll never have to do that again!**  

See instructions in the wiki: https://github.com/N129BZ/zodiacwb/wiki

### Note: These screenshots show arms in metric (mm) mode. 
### Imperial mode weights are in pounds, metric weights in kilograms.
