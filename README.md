# Zenith Zodiac Weight and Balance
### Application for calculating visible Weight and Balance information for Zenith 601xl and 650 aircraft

### Pounds or Kilograms functionality via menu: Edit -> Measurement Units -> Weight in Pounds or Weight in Kilograms  

### Print Screen button prints out a copy for your records - the FAA won't bust you for not knowing your numbers!
- **Note that the official Zenith 602/650 Weight and Balance arms are given in millimeters**, since the aircraft design was metric to begin with.
- **ALSO NOTE that the arm values for the aircraft loads are the official millimeter arms as designated by the designer, Chris Heintz**
- **USA aircraft use pounds for weights, so they would use the Weight in Pounds view, Metric countries would use the Weight in Kilograms view.** 
- **If your Empty Weight arm values are in inches, (for example, the AMD Zodiac POH lists the empty weight arms in inches):**
  -  Enter **Convert Mode** via menu: Measurement Units -> Convert Mode - Inches to Millimeters.
  -  Enter the inch arm values into the Empty Weight arm inputs. Entries will be immediately converted to millimeters.  
  -  Exit Convert Mode by clicking anywhere on the red instruction box.
  -  You will get a confirmation dialog asking if you want to save the entries.
  -  The application will re-load and all moments will be re-calculated.
  -  **You'll never need to do that again!**
