# Zenith Zodiac Weight and Balance
Application for calculating a visible w&amp;b chart for Zenith 601xl and 650 aircraft

This is a work in progress - Pounds or Kilograms functionality via menu: Edit -> Measurement Units -> Weight in Pounds or Weight in Kilograms
Print Screen button prints out a copy for your records - the FAA won't bust you for not knowing your numbers!
- Note that the official Zenith 602/650 Weight and Balance arms are given in millimeters, since the aircraft design was metric to begin with!
- If you have an AMD Zodiac and the POH lists the empty weight arms in **inches**:
  -  Enter **Convert Mode** via menu: Measurement Units -> Convert Mode - Inches to Millimeters.
  -  Enter the inch arm values into the arm inputs. Entries will be immediately converted to millimeters.  
  -  Exit Convert Mode by clicking anywhere on the red instruction box.
  -  You will get a confirmation dialog asking if you want to save the entries.
  -  The application will re-load and all moments will be re-calculated.
  -  **You'll never have to do that again!**
