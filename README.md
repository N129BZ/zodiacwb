# Zenith Zodiac Weight and Balance
Application for calculating a visible w&amp;b chart for Zenith 601xl and 650 aircraft

This is a work in progress - Imperial/Metric functionality via menu: Edit -> Measurement Units -> Imperial (lbs) or Metric (kg)
- Note that the official Zenith 602/650 Weight and Balance arms are give in millimeters, since the design was metric to begin with!

See instructions in the wiki: https://github.com/N129BZ/zodiacwb/wiki

### Note: These screenshots are in Metric (kg) mode. Imperial mode uses lbs.
